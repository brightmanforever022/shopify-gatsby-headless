            question: 'Where did Dose of Roses come from?',
            answer: "<p>The brand was founded by Joseph Ayoub, founder of some of the most well-known digital brands, and Julian Wilson, a former executive of the #1 most-searched fashion brand. Founded on January 6, 2019, Joseph and Julian were looking to start a new brand together and Valentine’s Day was right around the corner. Roses came to mind as they are the symbol of love and what most people give to their loved ones. Being different from the rest, they began selling this unique gift called the Rose Bear, a bear covered in synthetic roses that last a lifetime. After selling out completely in a matter of weeks, they started roaming through the stores of Los Angeles to find Rose Bears but weren’t able to find it as it was a relatively new product that wasn’t available in stores. Having no luck, they started looking for other gifts and that’s where they came across preserved rose arrangements. They had bought the entire inventory of multiple stores and had sold out of those in a matter of days. This is where the idea of gifting a unique luxury experience that isn’t the traditional bouquet of roses that only last a few days was born.</p><br><p>Today, you can create hundreds of different arrangements featuring unique shapes, colors, and sizes. Each arrangement contains anywhere from one to more than 150 Timeless Roses, and with proper care, your arrangement can last up to five years</p>"

        {
            question: 'What are Timeless Roses?',
            answer: "<p>The Timeless Roses used at Dose of Roses® come from the lush, vibrant rose fields of Ecuador. Each rose is carefully cultivated until it reaches full bloom. Each rose is treated with a formula made from non-toxic and non-allergenic wax, as well as natural oils. This formula is similar to silica and effectively dehydrates the roses to help preserve them. At the completion of the dehydration process, the roses soak in dye to give them the bright and vibrant colors you’ve come to expect from our gorgeous Timeless Roses. Once the roses are at their peak, they are picked and shipped to our facility in Los Angeles.</p>"
        },
        {
            question: 'Do Timeless Roses really last more than a year?',
            answer: "<p>Utilizing the process described above, our Timeless Roses will last up to five years or more with proper care, allowing you to enjoy their beauty month after month. With that in mind, beauty and elegance aren’t the only things people love about roses. They also love the smell!</p><p>The smell of roses is a wildly popular scent, whether it’s used in candles, perfumes, or the flowers themselves. With our Timeless Roses, you not only have the benefit of enjoying these roses for more than a year, but you can also enjoy the lovely scent of roses longer than you would with traditional roses.</p>"
        },
        {
            question: 'How do I care for my Timeless Roses?',
            answer: "<p>Dose of Roses® Timeless Roses, need minimal care. The dehydration process ensures that our roses are preserved at peak beauty, and water is not needed to keep them that way. In fact, if you want your roses to continue looking their best, it is important that you do not water them, and make sure you keep them contained in the box you received them in.</p><p>Make sure to keep your roses in a room-temperature environment, away from direct sunlight, and in an area where they are notat risk of being crushed. If you notice that your roses are looking a little dusty after a few months, then you can remove the dust with a little light dusting using a very soft and light-weight duster.</p>"
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I take the roses out of the box?',
            answer: "<p>No. For maximum preservation, we advise customers to not take the roses out of the box. The roses are nice and cozy and precisely placed within the box. Removing the roses will cause damage and ruin the arrangement.</p>"
